## Greetings! 👁👁👁

[scopalaffairs](https://scopal-affairs.com) is a moniker for the sectors I work on.

I combine art, technology and mindfulness to create solutions to complex problems. With a unique blend of skills in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Data Science, and Data Visualization, I have successfully delivered a diverse range of projects that have involved developing chatbots, creating recommendation systems, and much more. 

My background in film and media, as well as fine arts with a focus on painting, installations, and interactive media, has provided me with a wealth of experiences that I bring to my work. 

Through my profile, you can follow me bridging the gap between different teams, my participation in various hackathons and design competitions, and my eagerness to learn and collaborate with others to find new and exciting ways to leverage technology in creative ways.

If you are interested in discussing Data Science for your niche by value from data, I am always looking to exchange ideas with like-minded individuals.
