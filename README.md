## Greetings! ðŸ‘½ ðŸ‘¾ ðŸ¤–

Under the epithet [scopalaffairs](https://scopal-affairs.com), I navigate various sectors, synthesizing technology and mindfulness to address intricate questions and problems.

<hr/>

My realm spans Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Data Science, and Data Visualization, with proven success in various projects including the development of chatbots and the creation of recommendation systems. My background in diverse fields contributes an integrated perspective to technological projects.

<hr/>

My inquiries gravitate towards the study of fungal structures, organic algorithms, and rhizomatic growth. These interests guide my approach to technology and problem-solving, infusing my projects with insights gleaned from the natural world and systems thinking.
I am especially interested in the analogous relationships between mycological networks and neural structures. These naturally occurring systems exemplify efficiency, resilience, and adaptability, qualities that significantly influence and inspire my work in machine learning and data science.
